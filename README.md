# TwitterSearch

This is an extremely simplistic twitter search client that searches the twitter for a hashtag, displays the results returned and refreshes those results every 5 seconds.
I have already made another [twitter client](https://github.com/mohakshah/smashtag), which is much more feature-rich, as part of Stanford's online course CS 193P [Spring 2016]. But since that app used Stanford's framework to communicate with twitter, I decided to rewrite the framework myself.

## Building

This app is written in Swift 3. It was built using Xcode 8 and tested on iOS 10. There are no external dependencies, so you can simply open the project in Xcode, hit run and be on your way...
